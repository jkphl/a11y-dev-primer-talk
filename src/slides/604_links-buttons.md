## 4. Links & Buttons

- Links `<a>` **lead to a (remote) resource**
- Buttons `<button>` **trigger an action** (within the current resource)
- **NEVER** use `<div class="button" onclick="…">` — it's non-semantic, expensive and error-prone!
- There are complex cases: e.g. menu items, that are both submenu toggles and real links at the same time
