## 8. Focus order & visibility

- Keyboard focus must always be clearly visible
- **NEVER** use `outline: none` without alternative ([WCAG SC 2.4.7](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#focus-visible))
- Hidden content must not be focusable (e.g. accordion, carousel)
- Traceable document & focus order
- Attention: Flexbox & CSS Grid
- AT use linearized document form â†’ no skimming / scanning, no visual orientation
- Attention: Not all screen reader users are blind!
