## 10. Text alternatives for non-text content

- Every element has an **accessible name** which is computed [following a complex algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/) implying text content, `src`, `href`, `title`, `placeholder`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby` attributes
- Text alternatives for images and graphical UI components: [An alt Decision Tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/)
- Rule of thumb: Short, concise, essential info only
- Avoid verbiage (e.g. «Photo of …»)
