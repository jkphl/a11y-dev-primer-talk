## WAI-ARIA
- [Accessible Rich Internet Applications](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/): Supplementary vocabulary for HTML
- **Roles**: advanced semantic structures that aren't provided by native HTML, e.g. carousels, tree views, dialogs (`role="main"`, `role="navigation"`, `role="dialog"`)
- **States & Properties** via `aria` attributes: additional conditions that can't be expressed with HTML, e.g. relations between elements (toggle + menu), opening states, accessible names
- **Live Regions**: for communicating dynamic changes to assistive technolgies, e.g. error validation, dialog messages, lazyloaded data
- **Don't use ARIA!**
