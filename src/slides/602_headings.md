## 3. Headings

- Correct heading hierarchy is essential
- Important navigational aid for assitive technology ([WCAG SC 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#bypass-blocks))
- **«Only one `<h1>`!»** is an urban legend, but mostly reasonable
- Heading structure doesn't necessarily have to start with an `<h1>`
- **HeadingsMap** Extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/headingsmap/flbjommegcjonpdmenkdiocclhjacmbi) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/headingsmap/)
